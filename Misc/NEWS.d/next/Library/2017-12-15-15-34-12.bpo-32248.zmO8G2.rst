Add :mod:`importlib.resources` and :class:`importlib.abc.ResourceReader` as
the unified API for reading resources contained within packages.  Loaders
wishing to support resource reading must implement the
:meth:`get_resource_reader()` method.  File-based and zipimport-based loaders
both implement these APIs.  :class:`importlib.abc.ResourceLoader` is
deprecated in favor of these new APIs.
