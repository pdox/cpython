The subprocess module is now more graceful when handling a Ctrl-C
KeyboardInterrupt during subprocess.call, subprocess.run, or a Popen context
manager.  It now waits a short amount of time for the child (presumed to
have also gotten the SIGINT) to exit, before continuing the
KeyboardInterrupt exception handling.  This still includes a SIGKILL in the
call() and run() APIs, but at least the child had a chance first.
